        <h2>About Roberto Andrade</h2>
        <p> I am originally from Comitán, Chiapas, a small city in southern Mexico. I moved to Mexico City to study International Relations and Political Science, however, since I graduated, I started my career as a data scientist in the local government. Although the projects I have worked with are very different –from crime analysis to the response of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city–, they all have focused on delivering better public services through the use of data analysis and automation of processes. </p>
